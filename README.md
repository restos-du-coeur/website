# Restaurants du Cœur website

The Restaurants du Cœur (literally Restaurants of the Heart but meaning Restaurants of Love),
commonly and familiarly known as the Restos du Cœur, is a French charity, the main activity
of which is to distribute food packages and hot meals to the needy.

The association does not only target homeless but also all those with a low or very low income
(single families, old people with a low pension, young adults...). Now the association also helps
people to find housing and supports other projects. This not-for-profit association has the
"reconnu d'utilité publique" status which exempts it from specific taxes.
